# Licensebox for Nim

Linux native application SDK, backed by Licensebox C v0.3.0. Requires Nim 1.6.14+ with `--mm:arc --threads:on`. Other operating systems and cross compilation have not been validated. This SDK contains no server/admin credentials or administration API.

Install the native library using `bash scripts/install-native.sh /your/prefix`, or build/install the pinned C SDK yourself. Set `LICENSEBOX_LIB_DIR=/your/prefix/lib` for building and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/your/prefix/lib` for running. Headers are expected in `/your/prefix/include`. `LICENSEBOX_LIBRARY` is supplied by CI for consistency; this binding links `liblicensebox.so` through the Linux loader and uses `LICENSEBOX_LIB_DIR`/`LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. Native dependencies are OpenSSL and libcurl. HTTPS verification stays enabled.

Run `bash ci/test.sh` from this repository after installing the toolchain. `ci/setup.sh` installs prerequisites on a disposable Ubuntu 24.04 CI runner. The test script runs real binding tests, builds the language conformance adapter and compiles a consumer against the installed/package surface.

## Application API

Create a client with a JSON object:

```json
{"product":"your-product","keys":{"current":"YOUR_ED25519_PUBLIC_KEY"},"version":"1.0","directory":"/private/application/state","server":"https://licensebox.dev","ca_bundle":"/optional/trusted-ca.pem"}
```

Only `product` and `keys` are required. Omit optional values to use native defaults. `keys` maps signing-key IDs to unpadded base64url public keys. `ca_bundle` is optional; omit it for the system trust store. Never pass private signing keys. Do not expose trusted clock/binding callbacks as end-user configuration. Embedded NUL bytes in textual arguments fail closed.

Initialization: `let client = newClient(options)`. Operation: `client.call(operation, args)`. See [the complete example](examples/status.nim).

| Operation | JSON arguments | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `lease` | `{}` | verified lease |
| `require` | `{"module":"core"}` | verified lease authorizing that module |
| `status` | `{}` | locally verified lease |
| `sign_in` | `{"timeout":120}` | verified lease |
| `logout` | `{}` | `null` |
| `modules` | `{}` | module objects |
| `requests` | `{}` | access requests |
| `request` | `{"modules":["export"],"note":"reason"}` | submitted request |
| `access-link` | `{}` | private URL string |
| `record` | `{"command":"export","success":true,"elapsed":0.125}` | `null` |

Elapsed and timeout values are seconds. Usage collection obeys the server opt-in. Check protected access before reading user files. A protected call attempts renewal; it does not start a background heartbeat. Explicit server refusals fail closed. Unexpired verified cached leases can cover eligible transport outages; expired leases require a connection. Logout preserves the installation key. Keep lease/access-link/device-code values private.

Results are owned `JsonNode` values; errors are `LicenseboxError` with a stable `.code`. Clients are reference objects: aliases share state and `close` is idempotent. ARC releases unclosed handles. Compile with ARC or ORC and threads enabled. Calls and error capture share a lock.

The public callback record preserves context, sign-in `(context, url, user_code)`, trusted clock `(context) -> seconds`, trusted binding `(context, output, capacity) -> zero on success`, and cancellation `(context) -> nonzero when cancelled`. Retain context and every language callback until the client closes. C callbacks must never raise/unwind through C, terminate the process, or reenter a client. Leave clock/binding unset in production applications to use the native implementation. Use sign-in callbacks to display the URI and code.

Stateless primitives verify a signed lease, derive a namespaced binding from a trusted identity source, and read the native binding. They delegate to the same native implementation as client operations; parsing JSON never authorizes a feature. Raw native IDs must remain local.

## Conformance

With the shared protocol checkout at `../protocol`, run:

```sh
python3 ../protocol/conformance/run.py --adapter bash "$PWD/ci/adapter.sh"
```

All keys, host identifiers and records in tests are synthetic. The adapter executes operations in Nim. Trusted clock/binding callbacks are confined to the test adapter. The native library must be installed before testing.
